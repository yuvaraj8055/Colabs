# Colab Hacks [![Warning][Warning]](#Warning-Not-for-Cryptocurrency-Mining) [![License: MIT][License-Badge]](LICENSE.md)
Simple Hacks for Google Colaboratory to boost your productivity and help you to perform daily tasks.

Here is a brief about them all:


## [Colab RDP](Colab%20RDP/Colab%20RDP.ipynb) &nbsp;&nbsp; [![Open in Colab][Colab Badge]][RDP Notebook] [![RDP Issues][RDP Issues]](https://github.com/PradyumnaKrishna/Colab-Hacks/issues/labels/Colab%20RDP)

Colab RDP is used to get **Remote Connection** to Google Colaboratory and use it with graphic user interface which can be used in many ways. It give you high end VM for maximum 12 hours which boost your productivity and you can perform heavy task without any worries.

### **Some Points:**
 - Don't use username `root`
 - Enter Remote Desktop Headless code

<br />

## [Code Server](Code%20Server/Code%20Server.ipynb) &nbsp;&nbsp; [![Open in Colab][Colab Badge]][Code Notebook] [![Code Issues][Code Issues]](https://github.com/PradyumnaKrishna/Colab-Hacks/issues/labels/Code%Server)
Code Server is used to launch **VSCode** on browser using Agro Tunnel in Google Colaboratory which gives you better coding experience and you can use it for write code. Making a script to configure VSCode makes it more productive.

### **Going to add more functionality soon**

<br />

## [Torrent Downloader](Torrent%20Downloader/Torrent%20Downloader.ipynb) &nbsp;&nbsp; [![Open in Colab][Colab Badge]][Torrent Notebook] [![Torrent Issues][Torrent Issues]](https://github.com/PradyumnaKrishna/Colab-Hacks/issues/labels/Torrent%20Downloader)
Torrent Downloader is **Colab based Torrent Downloader** in which you doesn't need any torrent client only just a google account for downloading and storing downloaded torrents into google drive. It doesn't utilizes your internet for download and for any reason the download remains incomplete then you can resume it in other colab instance. Just Download from your drive if needed.

### **Some Points:**
 - Requires Google Drive authentication
 - Have both ways adding torrent via torrent file or using magnet link
 > **Note :** You can download any file and store it at google drive using command `wget <link>` and move it to the `/content/drive/My\ Drive/` location

## Warning: Not for Cryptocurrency Mining
> **Why are hardware resources such as T4 GPUs not available to me?**
The best available hardware is prioritized for users who use Colaboratory interactively rather than for long-running computations. Users who use Colaboratory for long-running computations may be temporarily restricted in the type of hardware made available to them, and/or the duration that the hardware can be used for. We encourage users with high computational needs to use Colaboratoryâ€™s UI with a local runtime.
Please note that using Colaboratory for cryptocurrency mining is disallowed entirely, and may result in being banned from using Colab altogether.
